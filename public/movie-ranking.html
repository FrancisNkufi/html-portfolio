<h2>My top 3 Movies of all times.</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
<h3>James Bond (007) all series but best from Casino Royal</h3>
<p>I believe Daniel Craig took this role personal. he delivered the best perfomance this franchise never had (modern 007).</p>

<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>One of the best action movie.</p>
<h3>Memory</h3>
<p>This old man keeps getting better with age.</p>
